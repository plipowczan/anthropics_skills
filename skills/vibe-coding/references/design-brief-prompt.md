# Design Brief Prompt Template

Use this prompt to help users create comprehensive design briefs before generating code.

## The Prompt

```
I need help creating a design brief for [type of project].

Please help me define:

1. Design Style & Aesthetic
   - What visual style best suits this project?
   - What mood/feeling should the design evoke?
   - Any specific design movements or styles to reference?

2. Target Audience
   - Who will use this?
   - What are their preferences and expectations?
   - What devices will they primarily use?

3. Key Features & Priorities
   - What are the core features to highlight?
   - What's the primary user action?
   - What should stand out most?

Based on my answers, create a comprehensive design brief that I can use with AI coding assistants.
```

## Example Usage

**User:** "I need help creating a design brief for a personal portfolio website."

**AI helps define:**
- Style: Minimalistic with neon accents
- Audience: Tech recruiters, freelance clients
- Key elements: Hero section, projects showcase, contact form

**Result:** Clear brief for subsequent implementation prompts.

## Why This Works

1. **Forces clarity** - User must think through core requirements
2. **Establishes constraints** - Prevents scope creep and generic designs
3. **Creates shared context** - Brief becomes reference for all future prompts
4. **Guides AI** - Specific brief = specific, relevant suggestions

## After Creating the Brief

Once you have the brief:

1. Save it as `design-brief.md` in your project
2. Reference it in all implementation prompts
3. Use it to create your AI Design Style Reference (see design-system-template.md)
4. Share it when requesting code from AI

The brief is your **north star** for the entire project.
