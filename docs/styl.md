## Przykładowe Fragmenty Reprezentujące Styl

### Fragment 1: Styl osobisty i refleksyjny

**Źródło:** `ABOUT/My career path.md`

```
My professional programming adventure began in the fourth year of college. I remember it like today - one of my friends during the vacations started working in one of the software development companies (such a current software house). I spent those vacations in the USA and he wrote to me that they needed someone else. I agreed to an interview and shortly after my return I started working as a junior .NET programmer. Due to my still ongoing studies, the working hours were irregular and unlimited. I worked as much as I could - I usually went straight to the company after class. Even then I paid attention to several aspects:

1.  I knew nothing - much of the time I had no idea what to do.
2.  There is nothing better than a good and helpful team.
3.  Programming is something for me - the satisfaction of completing projects is a great feeling.
4.  Unstructured and unlimited working hours suit me.
```

# How not to become a slave of your own business
## Three commandments:
1. You cannot loose.
 1. You are a winner from the start. Think of what you have and on start you have a lot. If you think about 3 things every day what you can be grateful [[LIFE/KNOWLEDGE/INFO/5 Minute Journal]] I guarantee - no matter who you are and in what situation you would be able to find those 3 things.
 2. Business/life is an endless game and if it is endless you cannot loose.
2. Development is a choice - you don't have to do it but it gives you a great advantage in terms of building a business but if you just do it the development will come since you will learn on. Avoid constant pressure that you need more, that there is something you can do. [[BOOK/Company of one]] #reading-list/business-finance
3. Enjoy it all - do it for fun (business and life). Enjoy the process and not only when you achieve something. Goal alternative:
 1. Values - what values you follow in life - write it down and stick to it and all decisions you make confront with those values.
 2. Direction - instead of defining a goal you can define a direction - you will avoid the pressure of not reaching the destination when you won't achieve the goal, if only you will go in the direction you defined you will be able to get somewhere and enjoy the process.

### Fragment 4: Notatki z książek - struktura szablonowa

**Źródło:** `LIFE/BOOKS/How to take smart notes.md`

```
# 🚀 The Book in 3 Sentences
The book is about how you should take notes in order to take advantage of them in the efficient way. It describes the slip-box technique and describe who invented it and how it worked for him. Approach to note-taking was inspired by the 20th-century German sociologist Niklas Luhmann.

# ☘️ How the Book Changed Me

This was the "why" for taking notes while reading and looking for the purpose of reading and learning specified stuff. The important thing for me was finding the purpose of note taking - it is not just collecting information; it is seeking to develop ideas and arguments. I try to read with a pen in my hand - I always did but now I know that it makes sense.

# Summary + Notes

Systematically make three types of notes to develop your ideas and arguments:
1. Fleeting notes - they don't go in a slip-box; they're simply for capturing ideas and thoughts. You can take them in a notebook, on a scrap of paper, or wherever works for you. Keep these notes in one place so you can go through them later.
2. Literature notes - notes about what you read. While you're reading, write down things you don't want to forget along with reference details. Your notes should be short and in your own words. These go into your reference slip-box– the first of the two slip-boxes.
3. Permanent notes - These will arise from your fleeting and literature notes, which you should go through regularly– preferably daily. As you review your notes, ask yourself what's relevant to your own ideas, your research, and your interests.

### Fragment 8: Długie cytaty z książek z własnymi komentarzami

**Źródło:** `BUSINESS/BOOKS/Amp It Up.md`

```
## 1. Raise your standards:

The late Steve Jobs was only inspired by "insanely great" things. He set a high bar for seemingly everything, and anything that didn't meet his standards was summarily rejected. Try applying "insanely great" as a standard on a daily basis and see how far you get. People lower their standards in an effort to move things along and get things off their desks. Don't do it. Fight that impulse every step of the way. It doesn't take much more mental energy to raise standards. Don't let malaise set in. Bust it up. Raising the bar is energizing by itself. Instead of telling people what I think of a proposal, a product, a feature, whatever, I ask them instead what they think. Were they thrilled with it? Absolutely love it? Most of the time I would hear, "It's okay," or "It's not bad." They would surmise from my facial expression that this wasn't the answer I was looking for. Come back when you are bursting with excitement about whatever you are proposing to the rest of us.

**Leaders can do two things that bring almost instant benefit. First, think about execution more sequentially than in parallel. Work on fewer things at the same time, and prioritize hard. Even if you're not sure about ranking priorities, do it anyway**. The process alone will be enlightening. Figure out what matters most, what matters less, and what matters not at all. Otherwise your people will disagree about what's important. The questions you should ask constantly: What are we not going to do? What are the consequences of not doing something? Get in the habit of constantly prioritizing and reprioritizing.
```
